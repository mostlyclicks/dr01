<h2>Family therapy</h2>

This model will take the clients on a journey through early recovery focusing on topics such as symptom identification, trigger identification, coping skills, neurobiology of addiction, the medical model of addiction, 12-Step Models, relapse planning, and prevention.</p>

Building relationships in the nationwide recovering services community is a priority for Driftless Recovery Services and we are always touring and building relationships with inpatient partners.</p> 
 
<h2>12 Step recovery</h2>
<p>Driftless Recovery has various 12- Step meetings operating in our meeting room frequently which we encourage our clients and their families to attend. You may also find a list of 12-step meetings here: 
 Sober Buddy Program: Based on the original Bridging the Gap program developed to help “bridge the gap” between therapy and the 12-Step recovery community. Our program is designed to have successful graduates of our outpatient programs, as well as outside 12-step members, serve as buddies, or mentors, to clients new to sobriety. We will pair clients with an appropriate buddy to help ease the transition from therapy to the community and take the skills they are being taught in therapy here at Driftless, and apply it to their everyday lives.</p> 

<h2>Aftercare</h2>
<p>Our aftercare program brings the client and families together to meet the family where their at. Aftercare can begin when a client has returned from an inpatient facility, successfully completed an outpatient program, or the family may obtain aftercare regardless of the status of their loved one. We work extensively with sober housing companies across the nation and locally to find the best fit for a client whether that is here at home or abroad. We continue to work with the client and family, no matter their location, to provide a continuity of care regardless of physical locale via telephone or video conferencing.</p>
